# Github login

Interactive Sessions automatically login into Github for you. You can clone any repositories into a Session using the [HTTPS cloning method](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line) \(SSH will not work\).

## Signed up with Github

If you signed up to Grid with Github, you'll already be logged into your Github account when an interactive Session starts.

## About private code

Grid does not save your code, look at it or compromise its privacy in any way.

When receiving support, you will not have to share any code to help debug. If you choose to share code, make sure you have the rights to and share non-critical parts of the code.
