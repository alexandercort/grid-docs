## Teams Collaboration

This feature is in [Early Access](../about-these-features/teams-features.md)! Contact us at [support@grid.ai ](mailto:support@grid.ai)to participate

Most users work as part of a team, collaborating, sharing and leveraging each other's work. The collaboration feature allows users to download each other's artifacts and logs, see what datastores are available to share in the team, mount datastores when creating a run or session.

## Multi-node Training

This feature is in [Early Access](../about-these-features/multi-node.md)! Contact us at [support@grid.ai](mailto:support@grid.ai) to participate

Distributed training of machine learning models saves time and enables researchers to train larger models. Grid can launch as many GPUs and nodes as you want in the cloud. The integration with Lightning is  also seamless.
