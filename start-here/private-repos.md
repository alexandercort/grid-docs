# Github Integration

## Link Public/Private Github Repos

By default, if you've logged in with Github, you can only access public Github repositories on Grid.&#x20;

To grant read access to your private code navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Grant access**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you've logged in for the first time with Google, you will need to link a Github account and grant access to repos.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## About private code

Grid does not save your code, look at it or compromise its privacy in any way.

When receiving support, you will not have to share any code to help debug. If you choose to share code, make sure you have the rights to and share non-critical parts of the code.
