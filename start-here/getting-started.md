# Setting Up Grid
To get the full power of Grid, it is important to integrate your Github account with your Grid account. This will enable Grid to then utilize your public repositories for training. You will also have the option to give Grid access to your private repositories; by default Grid will not have read/write access to your private repositories.

## Github Integration
By default, if you've logged in with Github, you can only access public Github repositories on Grid.&#x20;

To grant read access to your private code navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Grant access**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you've logged in for the first time with Google, you will need to link a Github account and grant access to repos.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## About private code

Grid does not save your code, look at it or compromise its privacy in any way.

When receiving support, you will not have to share any code to help debug. If you choose to share code, make sure you have the rights to and share non-critical parts of the code.
