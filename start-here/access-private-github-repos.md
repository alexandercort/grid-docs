# Access Private Github Repos

### Access Private Github Repos

By default you can only access public Github repositories on Grid. To grant read access to your private code, click on your profile icon from the Grid UI, navigate to Settings > Integrations > Grant access.

### About private code

Grid does not save your code, look at it or compromise its privacy in any way.

When receiving support, you will not have to share any code to help debug. If you choose to share code, make sure you have the rights to and share non-critical parts of the code.
