**CLI version: 0.8.3**

:heavy_check_mark: Support for specifying version of Julia image to use in Runs. We will support every patch release of julia from 1.6.1 up

`grid run --framework julia` will use the latest Julia version available (currently 1.7.1)

`grid run --framework julia:X.Y.Z` will use Julia with the version X.Y.Z 

<note>At this time, this feature is available for CLI users only</note>

:heavy_check_mark: Runs will fail more quickly if there is an issue with image building

:heavy_check_mark: Resolves issue with `--num_trials` parameter being ignored

:heavy_check_mark: Logging improvements to silence noisy stacktraces

:heavy_check_mark: 'pytorch' and 'torch' are now both equal and acceptable inputs to the framework option for `grid run` 

ex: `--framework pytorch` == `--framework torch`
