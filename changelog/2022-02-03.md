### **Artifacts don't sync for fast experiments**

We've detected a race condition with short-running experiments which may cause artifacts not to be properly synced. We're working on a long-term solution for this, and will be fixed in the coming days. As a workaround, we recommend ensuring your experiments last at least a minute (to be safe), and sleep if needed. **We are working on resolving this issue to be addressed in the next release.**
