### Cluster Contexts &#x20;

For users **B**ringing **Y**our **O**wn **C**loud, we've introduced the concept of cluster contexts. You can set the cluster context so that all your CLI actions (including creation of a resource such as Run or Session) are made against that cluster.

By default, the cluster context is set to the global cluster. You can change the context at anytime  by using the command: `grid user set-cluster-context` or by specifying the cluster name in `~/.grid/settings.json.`

Find out which cluster context is currently set by using the `grid user`command.

More information in the documentation on how to '[Run Workloads in Your New Cluster](https://docs.grid.ai/platform/custom-cloud-credentials/adding-custom-cloud-credentials#step-6-run-your-workloads-in-your-new-cluster)'.
