**CLI version: 0.8.4**

:heavy_check_mark: Resolves an issue where using a relative path for the `dependency_file_info` property in a Run config was breaking. For example, this now works: 
    ```# Dependency file specification
        dependency_file_info:
        package_manager: conda
        path: ./env/env-deepcdl-pytorch.yml ```

:heavy_check_mark: Support for specifying version of Julia image to use in Runs. We will support every patch release of julia from 1.6.1 up.

`grid run --framework julia` will use the latest Julia version available (currently 1.7.1)

`grid run --framework julia:X.Y.Z` will use Julia with the version X.Y.Z 

<note>At this time, this feature is available for CLI users only</note>

:heavy_check_mark: Runs will fail more quickly if there is an issue with image building.

:heavy_check_mark: Resolves issue with `--num_trials` parameter being ignored.

:heavy_check_mark: Logging improvements to silence noisy stacktraces.

:heavy_check_mark: 'pytorch' and 'torch' are now both equal and acceptable inputs to the framework option for `grid run` 

ex: `--framework pytorch` == `--framework torch`
