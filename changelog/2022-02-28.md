**CLI version: 0.8.1**

Spring cleaning came early. This release features a lot of backend magic that improves overall stability and UX with Grid. We’re also excited to announce a dazzling set of enhancements to Datastores! **You’ll notice uploading to Datastores is now at least 5x faster!** 
More details and information on how to use the feature are below.

Upgrade your CLI to `v0.8.1` with `pip install lightning-grid --upgrade`

### Datastore Improvements
<note>Starting with this release, you **must** update your CLI to `v0.8.1` or later to use Datastores</note>

- Datastore upload speeds increased by 5x
- Improved stability during Datastore uploads (reduced chance of failure during upload)
- Disk space usage will no longer increase during Datastore upload
- If a Datastore gets interrupted during upload, the next time you create a Datastore, you will be prompted to resume the upload
- The `--source` parameter has been deprecated. It will no longer be supported in future releases. You can just use `grid datastore create [filename]` and the datastore will inherit the filename as its name
- Additional magical backend improvements that you can't see, but certainly will feel 

### Notable Fixes and Enhancements

- `grid run` help menu includes additional information about the  `--localdir` option
- The following actions have been added to the YAML config:
    - on_build_start
    - on_build_end
    - on_experiment_start
    - on_experiment_end
    (See the docs on [Actions](https://docs.grid.ai/features/runs/actions#available-actions) for more information)
- Newly created datastores with total size <1 MiB will report as 1 MiB total size
- Improvements to costs reporting for runs and experiments
