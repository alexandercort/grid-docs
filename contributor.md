### Contributor guide for Documentation

**We are using Gitbook + Github integration to develop Documentation**

- Make sure to follow the workflows, examples, products sections
- Make sure to follow heading, paragraph, and hint conventions
- When adding code snippets, add as bash format so that it can be copied and pasted from Gitbook
- When adding code snippets for illustration, use carbon

**When updating the docs make sure to create a private branch and test locally and visually inspect the files for formatting errors.**

Timeline for review and merge of pull requests is 1 or 2 days
